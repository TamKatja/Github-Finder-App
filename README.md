# Github Finder App

Application to search for Github users and display their information using the Github API. Built with React, Tailwind CSS/DaisyUI and Vite. Uses the Context API with the useContext and useReducer hooks for state management. Built as part of my [React Front to Back course](https://www.traversymedia.com/).
